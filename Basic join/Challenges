--1 here i select only maximum no of challenges
-- 2  here more than one studen created same no of challenges and count is less than  maximum so i select   remove same no of challeges and its count less than 1 
-- 3 -> in this i extract distinct count  
-- 4 -> in this i extract count of challenges
-- 5 than i use count on count and having count = 1 that remove  more than one same no of challenges
